# Tweet-Analyzer

This analyzer explores Tweepy and the Twitter Streaming API.

To run:

1. This pipes the output of the streamed tweets to a txt file which can then be parsed
"python twitter_streaming.py > twitter_data.txt"

2. This outputs how many tweets were extracted, and produces 2 matplotlib visualizations. The parameters can be tweaked to produce visualizations for any sort of data
"python structure.py"

It is best to let the API call run for a few hours in order to get a massive sample size
